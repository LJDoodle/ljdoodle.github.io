    <h1>
      The Squad Blog
    </h1>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Claire, and I use the website to post (hopefully fairly regular) updates about my friends and I 
        (a group known, among other things, as the 'The Squad')!
    </p>
    
    <h2> 6-31-2023 (Week 26) </h2>
    <p> Good morning everyone! It's around the midpoint of this year, and around the midpoint of my summer vacation.
        As such, I'm in kind of a weird transitional period. I just finished my first set of 5-week summer classes,
        and I didn't sign up for any second-set classes (though that's not off the table yet), so I have a bit of downtime.
        Being me, I want to take this time for a little bit of self-edification, and work on my writing skills.
        After a long bit of thought and a chat with some of my friends, I decided to try my hand at a little bit of blogging.
        Manfred's letting me use this old website, so I'm also taking this opportunity to work on my HTML/CSS abilities (and trust me, 
        there's a lot of work to be done). <br> <br>
        I want to take a little bit of time before the actual 'blog' part to talk about my vision for this project.
        My plan is to try to share little pieces of my life with y'all as often as I can.
        That said, my life alone is not very interesting.
        So, as you can probably tell from the title of this weblog, it will mainly be focused on the antics of me and a few of my close friends.
        In the coming weeks, you'll probably learn a little more about them, but I'll start you off with just a brief overview:
        <ul>
            <li> Claire (that's me!) - I'm a college sophomore majoring in journalism, and I like reading, writing, and drawing.</li>
            <li> Manfred - The one who's letting me use his website. We've known each other since elementary school.
                He's majoring in computer science, and he likes playing golf and video games (he's 
                currently making his way through TOTK).
            </li>
            <li> Joseph - I probably know him the least out of anyone in the squad, 
                but he's probably Manfred's best friend, so he's around all the time. The two of them love playing quiz bowl together,
                because they're both nerds.
            </li>
            <li> Georgia - I met her through cross country, and we like to go exploring. 
                Georgia fancies herself an amateur ornithologist.
            </li>
            <li> Jaycee - They're a music major, and when they're not hanging out with us or their band (and sometimes even when they are),
                they make themselves very busy with all sorts of projects.
            </li>
        </ul>
